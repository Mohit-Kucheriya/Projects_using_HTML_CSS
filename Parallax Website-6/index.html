      <h2>Nature</h2>
      <p>
        The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are
        normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura
        meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms,
        landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of
        nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be
        man-made or called artifacts. There are natural sciences that study
        different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about
        plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of
        living thing. From one point of view, humans are a prime example of
        nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the
        planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural
        environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature everything from
        the air outside to the dirt on the ground is interdependent. Medicine
        studies humans in health and sickness. From another point of view,
        humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use
        natural resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and
        manufacture things from natural material. Fires, cars, and factories
        make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave
        nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often
        fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more
        people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

      <ul>
        <li>
         <b> Whispering Trees:</b> Trees can communicate with each other. They release
          chemical signals when under attack from pests, and nearby trees can
          pick up these signals and respond by producing chemicals to defend
          themselves. It's like the forest is talking!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Butterfly Migration:</b> Monarch butterflies are known for their
          incredible long-distance migrations. They travel thousands of miles
          from North America to Central Mexico to escape the cold and return in
          the spring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nature's Velcro:</b> The inspiration for Velcro came from nature. Swiss
          engineer George de Mestral created the concept after observing burrs
          sticking to his dog's fur during a walk. The tiny hooks on the burrs
          inspired him to develop the now-famous hook-and-loop fastener.
        </li>

          droplets. They often appear after rain showers.
